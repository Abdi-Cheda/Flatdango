Project Name: Movie Database Web Application

Description:
This web application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to browse a list of movies retrieved from a local server (http://localhost:3000/films). Users can see the movie titles on the left side of the interface and click on a title to view details about the selected movie on the right side. The application dynamically populates movie information and displays the movie title, description, poster, runtime, capacity, and showtime.

Usage:

The movie titles will be displayed on the left side of the interface.
Click on a movie title to view its details on the right side of the interface.
